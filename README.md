# User-Authentication-System
# Login System with SQLite and Python

This project is a simple login and registration system developed using **Python** and **SQLite**. It allows users to register a new account, securely store their passwords using **SHA-256 hashing**, and login to their accounts.

## Features
- User registration with unique username and password.
- Password hashing with SHA-256 to ensure security.
- User login validation using credentials stored in SQLite database.
- Error handling for invalid login attempts.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used to write the logic for registration, login, and password hashing.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database used for storing user data (username and hashed password).
- **SHA-256**: Hashing algorithm used to securely store passwords.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Login-System-Python.git
